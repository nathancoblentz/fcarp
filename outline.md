Welcome to Good Life Catering Company, Greenville SC!

	With hundreds of events to our credit, Good Life Catering Company is one of Greenville’s premiere catering and event planning outfits. Our award winning kitchen staff creates memorable culinary experiences that your guests will not soon forget. All of our professional chefs, servers, and bartenders have extensive training and are extremely passionate about their craft.
	If you want it, we can do it:

	From cold cuts to caviar; from sushi to shrimp and grits. Good Life Catering does not like to sell events in a laundry list or catalogue style, but prefers to meet with each individual client and design a menu that caters to his/her specific style and to his/her specific event.

	The menus that follow are merely samples. Let’s work together and brain storm your event and determine which foods and what level of service will make your event a perfect one. Our abilities extend well beyond the kitchen.

 From venue to DJ; Rentals to Bartenders; Florists to Photographers - If it’s a service you need, we can either provide it in-house or we can help you locate it.  Our feeling is that it is your event, so there is no reason why you shouldn’t have exactly what you want exactly the way you want it.
