This is my workflow for bass SASS/Bootstrap.

1. Clone the repo: http://github.com/nathancoblentz/gulpthings.git
2. run npm init
3. set SASS variables in _variables.scss
4. run **gulp** to generate tpm folder and server
5. save main.scss or any html files and the browser should auto refresh
6. run build to generate dist folder, with files optimized for deployment
